(with concrete and simple binomial pricing model, with risk neutral assumption)\\nI understand that for an European call option, (in Binomial pricing model), the price is simply:\\n$$V_n(\\\\omega) = \\\\frac{1}{1+r} (PV_{n+1}(\\\\omega H) + QV_{n+1}(\\\\omega T) )\\\\tag1$$\\nand from Early execise of American Call on Non-Dividend paying stock. and many other materials also state that early exercise of American call options is not optimal compared with selling it.\\nHowever, many materials also state or imply that European calls and American calls are identical when the underlying stock pays no dividends, which means (1) should apply right? (for anytime before maturity)\\nThis confuses me as I thought the pricing of an American call option should be:\\n$$V_n(\\\\omega) = max(S(\\\\omega) - K, \\\\frac{1}{1+r} (PV_{n+1}(\\\\omega H) + QV_{n+1}(\\\\omega T))) \\\\tag2$$\\nSo let's say if I have a deep in-the-money American call option for non-dividend stock (not expired), what is the price for this option?\\nBecause since early exercise is not optimal, which add no time value for the American call option, why should one pay for the option according to equation (2) instead of (1)?

And if we are simulating, $S_t^a$ and $S_t^b$, what happens if $S_t^a<S_t^b$?\\nWhilst in the Avellaneda and Stoikov paper, they only simulate the mid-price and then use the intensities as to whether the MM wealth changes.\\nOr is only $d X_t=(S_t+\\\\delta^a) d N_t^a - …$ simulated using the parameters we calculated from the historical LOB data?\\nSome insights would be greatly appreciated.',\n",

       " 'I have a question that is only tangentially related to quant trading but was wondering if some of the members of this forum could impart some of their typical wisdom.\\nFor context, in addition to trading some of my own systematic strategies, I invest a proportion of my account in systematic Hedge Funds and Private Equity. I work a full-time job so it’s too much work to invest completely without external help. In addition, I select for funds that have uncorrelated return streams and this provides my overall portfolio with some level of diversification. The funds I invest in have a live track record exceeding 20 years because I value (rightly or wrongly) the ability of a fund to adapt to various regimes/market cycles.\\nMy question is: is there a reasonable way to assess whether I should pull the plug of an underperforming fund? How can I assess when a fund has lost its edge and is no longer a reasonable investment? This question is similar to “when should I stop trading a systematic strategy?” but it’s a bit trickier due to the nature of hedge funds. Exiting a hedge fund incurs significant fees and exiting can sometimes take 3-6 months. In addition, once I’ve exited a fund, there are significant costs to re-entry should performance revive in the future. I don’t think a reasonable approach would, for example, be “generate a 200dma of the fund performance and enter/exit depending on whether the fund returns are above this ma.” This approach would incur too many fees.\\nThe other consideration that complicates the decision is the “fact” that the forward returns of private equity and systematic hedge funds tends to higher when the fund has incurred a drawdown. In fact, from my research (after trying to account for survivorship bias), I found that the steeper the drawdown, the better the forward performance, on average. Take trend following, as an example, I think forward returns for trend following strategies tend to be better after a period of underperformance. This has led some fund-of-funds to favoring a buy-the-dip approach.\\nAfter thinking about this issue, my thoughts on possible solutions are:\\nDon’t be concentrated in any individual fund. Then hold all funds “forever.” This will eliminate onerous entry/exit fees and prevent “selling at the low.” Of course, some funds will go to 0 and the money invested there will be a 100% loss. However, since concentration in any particular fund is low, this should be a survivable situation.\\nFind the maximum Peak-to-Trough drawdown over the entire fund history and exit when current returns dip below some multiple of this drawdown. For example, if maximum historical drawdown is 30%, exit if current drawdown is 45% (1.5x). Never re-enter. This would open up the possibility of selling on the lows. In addition, there are not that many good funds in the world :wink: so this strategy would reduce your selection to “inferior” candidates over time. The benefits of this approach would be to allow greater concentration on funds that you have high conviction on (since max risk would, in theory, be capped)\\nPlease let me know your suggestions/comments.

I'm curious where I am going wrong and which solution is correct (provided one of them is indeed correct).\\nLet $V_0$ be the value of our derivative security.\\nMethod 1: Pricing under the Risk-Neutral Measure\\n$V_0 = e^{-rT}\\\\tilde{E}(S_T^{2}log(S_T))$ where expectation is taken under the risk-neutral measure.\\nHere, I just compute the expectation directly with the help of the moment generating function as follows:\\nUnder the risk-neutral measure,\\n$S(t) = e^{ln(S_0) + (r-0.5\\\\sigma^2)t + \\\\sigma(W_t - W_0)}$\\nDefine a random variable $X \\\\sim N(ln(S_0) + (r-0.5\\\\sigma^2)T, \\\\sigma^2T)$.\\nSetting $log(S_T) = X$ and $S_T = e^X$, we have:\\nThen, $V_0 = e^{-rT}\\\\tilde{E}(Xe^{2X})$.\\nNow, we use the mgf of X to compute this expectation.\\n$M_X(s) = \\\\tilde{E}(e^{sX})$ and so by differentiating with respect to s and evaluating at $s=2$, we obtain:\\n$M_X'(2) = \\\\tilde{E}(Xe^{2X}) = (ln(S_0) + (r + 1.5\\\\sigma^2)T)S_0^2e^{(2r+\\\\sigma^2)T}$\\n(Here, I use that for $X \\\\sim N(\\\\nu, \\\\lambda^2)$, we have $M_X(s) = e^{s\\\\nu + 0.5s^2\\\\lambda^2}$ and thus $M_X'(2) = (\\\\nu + 2\\\\lambda^2)e^{2\\\\nu + 2\\\\lambda^2})$\\nHence, $V_0 = e^{-rT}\\\\tilde{E}(Xe^{2X}) = (ln(S_0) + (r + 1.5\\\\sigma^2)T)S_0^2e^{(r+\\\\sigma^2)T}$.\\nMethod 2: Using the stock as numeraire.\\nHere, $V_0 = S_0 \\\\hat{E}(S_Tlog(S_T))$ where expectation is taken under the stock measure.\\nUnder the stock measure,\\n$S(t) = e^{ln(S_0) + (r+0.5\\\\sigma^2)t + \\\\sigma(W_t - W_0)}$\\nDefine a random variable $X \\\\sim N(ln(S_0) + (r+0.5\\\\sigma^2)T, \\\\sigma^2T)$.\\nSetting $log(S_T) = X$ and $S_T = e^X$, we have:\\nThen, $V_0 = S_0\\\\hat{E}(Xe^{X})$.\\nUsing the same process as in Method 1, I get the exact same answer.\\n(the only difference in the process is that I evaluate the mgf at 1 for the first derivative instead of 2 and multiply by $S_0$ at the end instead of $e^{-rT}$).\\nMethod 3: Using the squared stock as numeraire.\\nHere, $V_0 = S_0^2 E^\\\\star(log(S_T))$ where expectation is taken under the associated measure.\\nUnder this change of measure with Radon-Nikodym Derivate $Z(t) = d\\\\hat{P}/d\\\\tilde{P} = e^{-rt}S_t^2/S_0^2$, I determined that the drift term is $(r+2\\\\sigma^2)$ for the stock process $S_t$. Since the diffusion term is unaffected by change in measure, we have:\\n$dS_t = (r+2\\\\sigma^2)S_tdt + \\\\sigma S_tdW^\\\\star_t$\\nThus, $S(t) = e^{ln(S_0) + (r+1.5\\\\sigma^2)t + \\\\sigma(W_t - W_0)}$\\nRecall we wish to compute $V_0 = S_0^2 E^\\\\star(log(S_T))$.\\nDefine a random variable $X \\\\sim N(ln(S_0) + (r+1.5\\\\sigma^2)T, \\\\sigma^2T)$.\\nSetting $log(S_T) = X$ we have:\\nThen, $V_0 = S_0^2\\\\hat{E}(X) = S_0^2(ln(S_0) + (r + 1.5\\\\sigma^2)T)$\\nSo, here I am missing that $e^{(r+\\\\sigma^2)T}$ term.\\nSo, what am I doing wrong?

But I am not yet convinced -- could someone please clarify the following reasoning.\\nTo me it seems that any time-value an (American) option might have is due pretty much exclusively to the volatility of the underlying asset (and partly on the riskless rate, but I\\'d like to ignore this for now), and so an option on a hypothetical asset with no volatility should have no time-value. My reasoning is as follows: suppose first that we have a hypothetical asset with no volatility (suppose also that the riskless rate is zero). This means the asset\\'s price is deterministic. In this case, the value of a call option must be [the present value of] $\\\\text{max}(S_m - K,0)$ where $S_m$ denotes the maximum that the spot price ever reaches (possibly infinite) and $K$ denotes the strike price. This remains the value of the call until the (first) time $t=t_1$ that the underlying asset reaches price $S_m$. After that time, the value of the option becomes $\\\\text{max}(S_{m,2}-K,0)$ where $S_{m,2}$ is the highest price the underlying asset reaches after $t_1$, and so on. Indeed this reasoning does demonstrate that the option value changes in time but not because of \"time-value\". In particular one could exercise the option at time $t=0$ thereby obtaining the stock at the strike price $K$ and then simply wait until time $t=t_1$ (assuming it exists) to sell it, thus realizing the maximum value of the option without holding it beyond time $t=0$. This strategy would be the same whether time $t_1$ is tomorrow or next year, and so the value is the same in both cases, thus the value is independent of time to any maturity date of the option. So, since there seems to be no time-value when the volatility is zero, any time-value must be entirely due to non-zero volatility.\\nWhere am I going wrong here? Thanks.',\n",

I've tried to read the description below repetitively, but I didn't get the idea.\\n\\nZDF starts with the assertion that an institution tries to find a funding source that has the same principal repayment factor as the instrument being funded. In essence, the institution strip funds each principal flow using its funding curve (that is, the transfer pricing yield curve). The difference between the interest flows from the instrument and its funding source is the net income from that instrument.\\nNext, ZDF tries to ensure consistency between the original balance of the instrument and the amount of funding required at origination. Based on the transfer pricing yield used to fund the instrument, the ZDF solves for a single transfer rate that would amortize the funding in two ways:\\nIts principal flows match those of the instrument.\\nThe Present Value (PV) of the funding cash flows (that is, the original balance) matches the original balance of the instrument.\\nZDF uses zero coupon factors (derived from the original transfer rates, see the example below) because they are the appropriate vehicles in strip funding (that is, there are no intermediate cash flows between origination date and the date the particular cash flow is received). The zero coupon yield curve can be universally applied to all kinds of instruments.\\n\\nHere is my interpretation:\\nlet the numerator num be: $B_0 - sum(B_n-1*D_n) + sum(B_n*D_n) = B_0 - Y + X$\\n$num = B_0 - \\\\sum_{i=1}^n B_{n-1} * D_n + \\\\sum_{i=1}^n B_{n} * D_n = B_0 - Y + X $\\nAssume n = 3,\\n$ num = B_0 -(B_0 * D_1 + B_1 * D_2 + B_2 * D_3) + (B_1 * D_1 + B_2 * D_2 + B_3 * D_3)$\\n$ num = B_0 -(B_0 * D_1 + B_1 * D_2 + B_2 * D_3) + (B_1 * D_1 + B_2 * D_2 + B_3 * D_3)$\\n$ num = B_0 + D_1(B_1 - B_0) + D_2(B_2 - B_1) + D_3(B_3 - B_2)$\\nThe general formual is\\n$ num = B_0 + D_1(B_1 - B_0) + D_2(B_2 - B_1) + D_3(B_3 - B_2) + .. + D_n(B_n - B_{n-1}) $\\n$ num = B_0 + \\\\sum_{i=1}^n D_n(B_{n} - B_{n-1}) $\\nas if the numerator represents the Initial value (which I'm not sure what it is) + the discount factor for the net value of the current period\\nThen it is divide by Y, which I have no idea of the its meaning except it converts it to a Zero-rate\\nFinally it is multiplied by 1/p to get the annual rate.\\nMy question is: What does this formula really mean?

       " \"I'm trying to come up with a method to calculate fair IVs for SPX options based on historical data.  I can't find much information on this so here's how I've thought to do it:\\n\\nDetermine a metric for approximating future volatility.  This could be as simple as using the current VIX value or could be any desired method.\\nIdentify days with the N most similar historical values of the metric.  So if the VIX were used as the metric and the current day has a VIX reading of 14, you might end up selecting all days where the VIX was between 13.5 and 14.6.\\nFit a distribution to those days.  I tried a few but only got somewhat reasonable results with skewed Cauchy, asymmetric laplace, and metalog.  I would have tried the skewed Student's T distribution but I can't find a Python package that has a fit function.  I tried both the raw and log strikes and got similar results.\\nI treat the cdf values from the distribution as option deltas and solve for IVs that match the deltas.  Certain contracts have a non-monotonic relationship between deltas and IV, so I just use the smaller of the IVs when that happens.  If I don't do that, I get an even messier result.\\nThe issue is that I'm getting breaks in the IVs.  I'm able to partially solve that by applying a median filter, but it's too severe for many longer dated contracts.  I think the issue is caused by the fact that the mean/median of the historical data is different than the expected drift based on Black-Scholes (takes into account the risk free rate and dividend yield), but even if I adjust for that by just sliding the distribution to the expected drift, it helps but doesn't completely resolve the issue.\\n\\nHere are some metalog examples, the first two where it looks pretty good and two where it doesn't.  So basically it gets messy at under a month out (the other distributions hold up better for later expirations but don't look as nice for near term expirations), but note that without the median filter, even the first two would have big spikes near the current SPX value.\\nThe only other thing I can think to do is use np.polyfit to create smooth curves but then I'd have to figure out how to tune the number of degrees, which might be different for every expiration.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere is some information out there about fitting distributions to returns but I couldn't find anything relating this to setting IVs.  I would at least expect to have smooth curves even if the first two steps above were misguided, but I'm getting getting discontinuous curves instead.\\nI'm hoping someone can provide feedback or hopefully a better approach.\",\n",

Net Delta is calculated for each option contract using the following formula:\\nNet Delta = 100 * Delta * Open Interest\\nThe x-axis is strike price and the y-axis is net deltas. Here is an example using SPY with a date range of 1/16/2024 to 1/17/2024:\\n\\nIn order to reduce the noise on the chart I have incorporated filters, one of which being a range of deltas. For example, if the user selects a delta range of 0-0.25 (-0.25 for puts) then contracts that don't fall within that range will be filtered out and not plotted.\\nThis is where I'm unsure how to parse the data. Consider this example -- let's say a date range consisting of 5 unique expiration dates is selected. The 100 strike call expiring on x date has a delta of 0.15 -- so this contract is added to the plot. But the 100 strike call expiring on n date has a delta of 0.55.\\nMy question is this: because I am plotting by strike price should I incorporate all option contracts for a given strike if just one contract meets the delta filter? Or only plot the data that meets the filter?\\nI might be overthinking this but I am currently plotting ALL contracts if one contract makes the cut. My reasoning is that if a given strike price is displayed on the chart then all data for that strike price should be displayed, not cherry picked. But I also want the data to be useful and accurate -- if only 1 out 20 contracts meets the filter and I'm plotting 19 other data sets that don't meet the criteria perhaps that's not an accurate representation of the data?\\nThoughts?\",\n",

This is the Thiele differential equation for a health insurance with the states 0=dead, 1=sick and 2=healthy. This insurance have an annual sickness benefit payment made to the policyholder when in state 1=sick, this is $b^1(t)$, and no premiums. The reason for having no premiums is because we want to determine a single fair premium to be paid from the time point when a healthy individual turns 50. The health insurance is active from when the policyholders turns 50 up until the individuals 65 birthday. The mortality is described by the cohort mortality given by the Makeham-function:\\n$$\\n\\\\mu(t)=a+bexp\\\\{ct\\\\}\\n$$\\nwhere t here should be thought of as age in years. The interest r(t) is assumed to be constant over calendar years, as is $\\\\mu_{12}$ and $\\\\mu_{21}$. There is no mention of any other costs or benefit payments being made when transitioning between states, hence no death benefit.\\nAfter I have solved the Thiele differential equations, I illustrate how the reserves evolve as a function of time. From this, I can determine the fair premium assuming that the premium income should equal the expected cost (reserves) in this case.\\n\\nThe dotted red line represent reserves in state 2=healthy, the other line represent reserves in state 1=sick.

However, financial data embeds volatility clustering, i.e., high/low volatility regimes cluster together, and, by construction, the HL estimated in an OU framework does not capture in which volatility regime is our process. Intuitively, mean reversion should be faster in a high volatility regime, and therefore HL shorter, than in a low volatility regime.\\nQuestion(s):  (a) How it is possible to model OU process by capturing volatility clustering feature of the time series and distinguish between high and low volatility regimes?

The population of $I$ traders is $N$ (namely $n=1,\\\\dots,N$) and that of $U$ traders is $M$ (namely $m=1,\\\\dots,M$). Both of them have CARA preferences denoted as\\n$$u_n(\\\\pi_{I_n}) = -e^{-\\\\rho_I\\\\pi_{I_n}}, \\\\quad \\\\text{and} \\\\quad u_m(\\\\pi_{U_m}) = - e^{-\\\\rho_U\\\\pi_{U_m}}$$\\nwhere $\\\\pi_{I_n} = (u-p)x_n$ and $\\\\pi_{U_m} = (u-p)x_m$ where $\\\\rho_I$ and $\\\\rho_U$ stunds for the risk averstion of the informed and the uninformed traders. $u\\\\sim N(0, \\\\sigma_u^2)$ is the value of the risk asset, $p$ denotes its price. Each informed trader has a signal $s_n = u + e_n$ and the noise traders stochastic demand is traded as $z \\\\sim N(0, \\\\sigma_z^2) $. All $n+2$ random variables $u, z, e_1, \\\\dots, e_n$ are inpepedently distributed. The author says that solving for the demand functions of the players, then\\n$$X_n(p, s_n)= \\\\mu_I +\\\\beta s_n - \\\\gamma_I p, \\\\quad \\\\ Y_m(p) = \\\\mu_U - \\\\gamma p\\\\tag{1}$$\\nand the market clearing condition of for the price is equilibrium is given by the following calculation\\n$$\\\\sum_{n=1}^NX_n(p, s_n) + \\\\sum_{m=1}^MY_m(p) - z = 0\\\\tag{2}$$\\nKyle while solving for the demand schedules of the traders for which he initially claims that they have form as in $(1)$ (which is intuitive since demands are linear and decreasing with respect to the price and the utilities are ending up to have quadratic forms because of the CARA normal preferences). He shows that there is some power called $\\\\lambda$ that in essence moves the prices and comes from the strategic demands of the traders. After solving the problems of the informed and the uninformed traders he ends up with the following\\n$$x_n^* = \\\\frac{\\\\mathbb{E}[u|p^*, s_n]-p^*}{2\\\\lambda_I + \\\\rho_I\\\\mathbb{V}ar[u|p^*, s_n]}, \\\\quad \\\\text{and} \\\\quad y_m^* = \\\\frac{\\\\mathbb{E}[u|p^*]-p^*}{2\\\\lambda_U + \\\\rho_U\\\\mathbb{V}ar[u|p^*]}\\\\tag{3}$$\\nI can not understand how this $\\\\lambda_I$ and $\\\\lambda_U$ emerges in the above solutions.

I am following the derivation in Appendix 12.6 of Rebonato's Bond Pricing and Yield Curve Modeling (pages 202-205). I am coming to a different formula than Rebonato for the excess returns, assuming that we have solved for the market price of risk vector $\\\\lambda \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{p}$, and I would like some assistance in resolving the discrepancy.\\nSetup:\\nAssume we have $n$ factors $x_i$ which have the following dynamics:\\n$$\\ndx_i = \\\\mu_i \\\\, dt + \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\\\sigma_{i, k}\\\\, dz_{i},\\n$$\\nwhere $z_1, \\\\dots, z_n$ are independent Brownian Motions. Moreover, assume that each of our $n+1$ bonds $P^1, \\\\dots, P^{n+1}$ has the dynamic\\n$$\\ndP_{i} = \\\\mu_{P^i} P^{i} \\\\, dt + \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\\\sigma_{P^i}^{k} P^i \\\\, dz_{k}.\\n$$\\nThat is, each bond can be shocked by each of the n Brownian Motions with each bond having a specific volatility corresponding to each $z_{i}$.\\nLastly, let's assume that we have gone through the computation for the market-price-of-risk vector $\\\\lambda$, the vector is independent of any zero coupon bond, and for any bond $P^j$ we have the formula for excess returns:\\n$$\\n\\\\underbrace{\\\\mu_{j} - r_t}_{\\\\text{excess return}} = \\\\lambda^\\\\top\\\\begin{pmatrix}\\\\sigma_{P^j}^{1}\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\ \\\\sigma_{P_{j}}^{n}\\n\\\\end{pmatrix} \\n$$\\nDecomposition of EXCESS RETURNS into Duration, Volatility, and Market-Price-of-Risk\\n(ISSUE IS HERE)\\nRebonato claims that the coordinates of the volatility vector $\\\\sigma_{P^j}^{k}$, $k=1, \\\\dots, n$, have the form\\n$$\\n\\\\sigma_{P^j}^{k} = \\\\frac{1}{P^j} \\\\frac{\\\\partial P^j}{\\\\partial x_k}\\\\, \\\\sigma_{k},\\n$$\\nwhere $\\\\sigma_k$ is the total volatility of the $k$-th factor\\n$$\\n\\\\sigma_{k} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\\\sigma_{i, k}^{2}}.\\n$$\\nNote that $\\\\sigma_{i, k}$ comes from the dynamics for $x_i$.\\nExpanding the excess returns equation into a sum gives a beautiful breakdown:\\n$$\\n\\\\text{Excess Return} = \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\\\underbrace{\\\\frac{1}{P^j} \\\\frac{\\\\partial P^j}{\\\\partial x_k}}_{\\\\text{Duration}}\\\\, \\\\times\\\\, \\\\underbrace{\\\\sigma_{k}}_{\\\\text{total volatility}}\\\\,\\\\times \\\\, \\\\underbrace{\\\\lambda_{k}}_{\\\\text{Market-price-of-risk for factor $k$}}. \\n$$\\nHowever, I am getting a different, perhaps messier, formula. Expressing the bond price $P^j$ as a function of $t$ and each of the factors $x_i$ and applying Ito's Lemma gives\\n\\\\begin{align*}\\ndP^j &= \\\\frac{\\\\partial P^{j}}{\\\\partial t}\\\\, dt + \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\\\frac{\\\\partial P^j}{\\\\partial x_k}\\\\, dx_k + \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\sum_{i, \\\\ell =1}^{n} \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 P^j}{\\\\partial x_i \\\\partial x_\\\\ell}\\\\, dx_i\\\\, dx_\\\\ell\\\\\\\\\\n&= \\\\bigg[ \\\\frac{\\\\partial P^{j}}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\\\frac{\\\\partial P^j}{\\\\partial x_i} \\\\mu_{i} + \\\\text{Convexity Term}\\\\bigg] \\\\,dt + \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\\\frac{\\\\partial P^j}{\\\\partial x_i}\\\\bigg(\\\\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\\\sigma_{i, k}\\\\, dz_{k} \\\\bigg)\\n\\\\end{align*}\\nI assume this last part is where Rebonato is getting his formula from. However, if we pair the above formula with the assumed dynamics for the bond price at the top, and we equate the volatilities to each other, we have\\n$$\\n \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\\\sigma_{P^i}^{k} P^i \\\\, dz_{k} = \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\\\frac{\\\\partial P^j}{\\\\partial x_i}\\\\bigg(\\\\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\\\sigma_{i, k}\\\\, dz_{k} \\\\bigg).\\n$$\\nHence, equating terms which are attached to $z_k$ on both sides (which requires flipping the order of summation on the right), we have\\n$$\\nP^{j} \\\\sigma_{P^j}^{k}\\\\, dz_{k} = \\\\bigg(\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\\\frac{\\\\partial P^j}{\\\\partial x_i} \\\\sigma_{i, k}\\\\bigg)\\\\, dz_k,\\n$$\\nand lastly\\n$$\\n\\\\sigma_{P^j}^{k} = \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\\\frac{1}{P^j}\\\\frac{\\\\partial P^j}{\\\\partial x_i} \\\\sigma_{i, k}.\\n$$\\nSo, rather than an individual duration factor, as Rebonato has, we have a summation of durations with respect to the factors $x_i$ multiplied by each factor's volatility to the shock term $z_{k}$. Plugging this into the Excess Returns formula, we have\\n$$\\n\\\\text{Excess Return} = \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\\\bigg[\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\\\frac{1}{P^j}\\\\frac{\\\\partial P^j}{\\\\partial x_i} \\\\sigma_{i, k} \\\\bigg]\\\\,\\\\times \\\\, \\\\lambda_{k} \\n$$\\nHere, the market-price-of-risk is not associated to the factor $x_k$, but rather to the underlying shocking force $z_k$, and that might be where the discrepancy comes in. However, I am not sure what Rebonato is doing precisely when he accumulates all of the shocking volatilites $\\\\sigma_{i, k}$ into a total volatility, so if anyone who is familiar with this derivation or who has read the book could help, that would be greatly appreciated.\",\n",
